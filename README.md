# Pointing Party
Welcome to Elixir School's workshop on Real-Time Phoenix with Channels, PubSub, Presence and LiveView! This application exists to guide workshop participants through each of these topics by allowing them to build out a set of features to support a fantastically fun game of "pointing poker".

Collaborators can sign in with a username and click a button to start the "pointing party". Tickets are displayed for estimation and each user can cast their store point estimate vote. Once all the votes are cast, a winner is declared and the participants can move on to estimate the next ticket.

The master branch of this app represents the starting state of the code for this workshop. Clone down and make sure you're on the master branch in order to follow along.
